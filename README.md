# SummerIntern-IIT-Ropar
This Repository contains all the codes that were used in Reinforcement Learning of an agent in a 5x5 gridworld environment with Terminal and non-terminal states during my Summer Internship 2020 (Reinforcement Learning) remotely under Department of CSE,IIT Ropar.

REWARDS (Value Iteration Algorithm):

          1. Reward in each state is +1 except the terminal states.
          2. The probability of all directions (N, S, W, E) = (0.2, 0.3, 0.25, 0.25).
